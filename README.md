# SciPy-2018-Enthought-Prabhu-R-Mayavi-Notes

My Python notes / notebooks based on Prabhu Ramachandran's video 3D Visualization with Mayavi - SciPy 2018 Tutorial.

All code was originally authored by Prabhu Ramachandran.

I edited and modified the code and transferred over the code and concepts into notebook form.
